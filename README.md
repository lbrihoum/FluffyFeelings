## Fluffy Feelings
- Project Description -
Fluffy Feelings is an android mobile application using Android Studio to help improve positive mental health that will showcase cute pictures of animals to cheer up users. The application will begin with a screen to welcome the user and allow them to login with Google Plus or Gmail. Once the user is welcomed, they will approach a dashboard where it will showcase plenty of buttons with animals on them. The user will click what animal they would like to look at and click that button corresponding to the animal and will be shown pictures of that animal from our database. In doing this, the user will feel happier seeing cute pictures of animals.
