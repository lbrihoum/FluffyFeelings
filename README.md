# Fluffy Feelings
## Project Description 
Fluffy Feelings is an android mobile application using Android Studio to help improve positive mental health that will showcase cute pictures of animals to cheer up users. The application will begin with a screen to welcome the user and allow them to login with Google Plus or Gmail. Once the user is welcomed, they will approach a dashboard where it will showcase plenty of buttons with animals on them. The user will click what animal they would like to look at and click that button corresponding to the animal and will be shown pictures of that animal from our database. In doing this, the user will feel happier seeing cute pictures of animals.
## Login Page
When a user interacts with our application, they are welcomed with the User Login Page. This page allows users to login using their Google credentials as well as a preset username and password saved in our Firebase. When the “Login” button is clicked, it will authenticate the user using Google Firebase. The “Login” button navigates to the Animal Choice Screen after authentication
## Animal Choice Page
The user then navigates to the Animal Choice Page. On this page, users are able to select one category to curate the content they wish to see. Users are only able to view one category at a time.
